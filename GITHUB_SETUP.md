# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Private GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub - Create New Repository](https://github.com/new)
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Repository name**: `engineering-cost-calculator` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Comprehensive engineering cost calculator with budget analysis and fee calculations"
   - **Visibility**: Select **Private**
   - **Important**: Do NOT check any of these boxes:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license

3. Click **Create repository**

### 2. Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# If you haven't committed yet:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Engineering Cost Calculator application"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with the repository name you chose

### 3. Authentication

When pushing, you'll need to authenticate:

- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

#### Creating a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings - Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Engineering Calculator Upload")
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click **Generate token**
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### 4. Verify Upload

After pushing successfully, your repository will be available at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

## What Gets Uploaded

✅ **Included**:
- All source code (TypeScript, React, Express)
- Configuration files
- Database schemas
- README and documentation
- Package files

❌ **Excluded** (via .gitignore):
- node_modules/
- .env files
- Build outputs (dist/)
- Temporary files
- IDE configuration files

## Next Steps

After uploading to GitHub:

1. **Add collaborators** (if needed):
   - Go to Settings → Manage access → Invite collaborators

2. **Set up environment variables** on deployment:
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL connection

3. **Configure deployment** (optional):
   - GitHub Pages for static hosting
   - Vercel/Netlify for full-stack deployment
   - Or continue using Replit for hosting

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Ensure the token has `repo` scope for private repositories

### "Repository not found"
- Check that you've created the repository on GitHub first
- Verify the repository URL is correct

### "Permission denied"
- Ensure the repository is set to private (as intended)
- Check that you're logged in with the correct GitHub account

## Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI approach:

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add" → "Add Existing Repository"
4. Select your project folder
5. Commit your changes
6. Click "Publish repository" and select "Keep this code private"
