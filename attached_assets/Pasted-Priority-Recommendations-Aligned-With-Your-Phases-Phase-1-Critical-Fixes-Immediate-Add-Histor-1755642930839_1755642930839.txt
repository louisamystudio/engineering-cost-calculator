Priority Recommendations (Aligned With Your Phases)
Phase 1 – Critical Fixes (Immediate)

Add Historic Property and Remodel Multiplier Controls — Provide toggles/slider to select 1.0 vs 1.2 for historic property and allow remodel multiplier adjustments.

Implement Interactive Cost Range Sliders — Turn the new/remodel cost ranges into three‑point sliders with user‑editable targets.

Add Site Area Input — Expose site area to support Scan to BIM calculations.

Category Selection — Allow category (1–5) selection and map it to the correct multiplier.

Phase 2 – Fee Analysis Implementation (High Priority)

Top‑Down Analysis Section — Build a table with all scope items (scan to BIM, architecture, interior design, landscape, each engineering discipline) showing percent of cost, rate per ft², market fee, Louis Amy fee, consultant fee and coordination fee, reflecting the fee formulas.

Bottom‑Up Analysis Section — Provide labour and overhead rates, markup, discount fields, and compute labour cost, overhead, markup, and final fee. Allow team member rate adjustments and show hours by role.

Hours Distribution by Phases and Roles — Display how total hours break down by phases (and allow overrides), plus leverage percentages per employee role.

Sanity Check Section — Compare top‑down vs bottom‑up results, show percent differences, and let users override discounts or apply manual adjustments.

Phase 3 – Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

Scan to BIM Calculations — Implement formulas for both building and site scanning (cost rates from your CSV and Excel).

Coordination Fee and Markup Controls — Add a default 15 % coordination fee for outsourced disciplines and let the user adjust markup percentages.

Expandable Budget Cards — Make budget cards expandable to reveal new vs remodel splits and underlying formulas.

Discount Application and Overrides — Provide fields to enter discounts for the top‑down fees and reflect them in the final costs.

Phase 4 – UI/UX Improvements (Lower Priority)

Interactive Charts and Sliders — Replace static numbers with dynamic charts (e.g., donut charts for cost ratios) and range bars for cost analysis.

Real‑Time Validation — Validate user inputs so shares sum to 100 %, costs remain within min/max ranges, etc.

Collapsible Sections — Organize the page into collapsible panels to mirror the Excel’s sequence (Inputs → Budgets → Discipline Budgets → Fee Analysis → Hours → Sanity Check).
