After exploring the updated Comprehensive Calculator thoroughly, here‚Äôs a detailed report on the interactive elements and calculations:

‚úÖ Functions Working Correctly

Cost range sliders: Both new‚Äëconstruction and remodel $/ft¬≤ sliders are interactive. Dragging the markers recalculates budgets immediately

.

Remodel target slider: Once dragged, it updates the remodel budget correctly; for example, setting the remodel target to $172/ft¬≤ produces a $994‚ÄØk remodel budget

.

Bottom‚Äëup fee fields: The labour rate, overhead rate, markup factor and discount inputs are editable and propagate into the bottom‚Äëup fee calculation instantly

.

Telecom budget & fee: Telecommunication now appears in the budget and fee tables with a non‚Äëzero value

.

Historic property and remodel multiplier controls: Toggles and sliders exist to select historic property (1.2√ó cost) and remodel multiplier (0.5 default)

.

In‚Äëhouse vs outsourced toggles: Each discipline has a switch; outsourced services correctly move fees to the consultant and add coordination (15‚ÄØ%)

.

Non‚Äëlinear hours formula: A toggle in Advanced Settings enables the non‚Äëlinear hours calculation, and the hours distribution table displays hours per phase and per role

‚ùó Problems and Missing Features

Share overrides not wired: Editing Shell, Interior or Landscape share override values (e.g. changing Shell from 70‚ÄØ% to 75‚ÄØ%) does not reallocate budgets; Interior and Landscape shares remain unchanged and totals don‚Äôt update
b17d8db1-963b-48a5-9ec0-f17f698e5a4a-00-opn8c8wtw1oj.picard.replit.dev
.

Discipline share overrides absent: The cards for Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing and Telecommunication have ‚Äú% Override‚Äù labels, but they aren‚Äôt interactive
b17d8db1-963b-48a5-9ec0-f17f698e5a4a-00-opn8c8wtw1oj.picard.replit.dev
.

Area slider increments buggy: Adjusting the New Building Area slider with arrow keys jumps in thousands of square feet, making fine adjustments impossible
b17d8db1-963b-48a5-9ec0-f17f698e5a4a-00-opn8c8wtw1oj.picard.replit.dev
.

Historic property toggle and remodel factor do not recalc budgets: Turning the historic toggle or changing the remodel multiplier does not update budgets until another slider is moved
b17d8db1-963b-48a5-9ec0-f17f698e5a4a-00-opn8c8wtw1oj.picard.replit.dev
.

No new/remodel split per discipline: The discipline budget cards display only a total; they don‚Äôt show how much of each budget comes from new vs remodel.

No sanity check section: There‚Äôs no panel comparing top‚Äëdown vs bottom‚Äëup fees, or showing market price, maximum discount and final contract price, as specified in the Excel.

Category multiplier cannot be changed after creation: The category label (e.g. 1.3√ó for Category¬†5) appears but there‚Äôs no control to adjust it.

No discipline‚Äëlevel discount or margin controls: While bottom‚Äëup fields exist, there‚Äôs no way to apply discounts or margins per scope, nor to turn disciplines off entirely.

No visual charts: There are no donut charts or stacked bars for new vs remodel ratios or discipline budgets; everything is presented in tables.

üöß Guidance for Next Steps
To align the app with the Excel model and the to‚Äëdo list:

Make all share overrides functional: When a user changes shell/interior/landscape percentages or discipline shares, recalculate budgets in real time and validate that totals remain 100‚ÄØ%.

Display new vs remodel splits for each discipline: Add fields in the discipline cards to show and edit the new and remodel portions separately, applying the remodel reduction only to structural.

Ensure every input triggers recalculation: Link the historic property toggle, remodel cost factor and area sliders directly to the budget calculation so changes take effect immediately.

Add a sanity check panel: Provide market vs contract price comparison, maximum discount and final price, with manual discount override, and display the variance between top‚Äëdown and bottom‚Äëup fees.

Allow category selection and override: Let users choose Category¬†1‚Äë5 from a dropdown and override the multiplier if needed.

Implement full interactive fee controls: Give the option to toggle disciplines on/off, set labour rates, overhead, markup and discount per discipline and compare top‚Äëdown vs bottom‚Äëup results.

Enhance data visualisation: Introduce donut charts for new/remodel ratios, stacked bars for discipline budgets and sliders with min/max/target markers for cost ranges.

Clarifications answered for the agent developer (from earlier requests):

Historic Multiplier: Keep 1.2√ó (not 1.4√ó) as the standard multiplier for historic property costs.

Default in‚Äëhouse disciplines: Architecture, Interior, Landscape, Structural, Civil and Plumbing should default to in‚Äëhouse; Mechanical, Electrical and Telecommunication should default to outsourced.

Validation thresholds for sanity checks: Current warnings at <0.3 or >1.5 hours/ft¬≤ are reasonable; keep these unless directed otherwise.

Export format: The export should include both the configuration values and a summary of the calculation methodology so clients can audit the numbers.

In its current state, the application satisfies many Phase¬†1‚Äì3 requirements but lacks several interactive controls and advanced reporting features. Implementing the above changes will bring it in line with the comprehensive Excel model and fully meet user expectations.
