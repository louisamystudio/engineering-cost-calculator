Updated Audit and Agreement on Missing Features
1. Interactive Cost Range Sliders

Current status: The dashboard shows min/target/max values for New Construction and Remodel cost per ft², but the target is fixed and cannot be overridden.

Missing: User‑adjustable sliders for new and remodel $/ft² with min/target/max markers and the ability to manually set the target.

Impact: Without sliders, users cannot explore different cost scenarios or fine‑tune the target cost within the defined range.

2. Historic Property and Remodel Multipliers

Current status: A remodel cost factor slider exists, but the “Historic Property Multiplier” (1.0 vs 1.2) is missing, and remodel multiplier is hard‑coded at 0.5.

Missing: Controls for historic properties and remodel cost factors. These affect all subsequent budgets and fees.

3. Complete Fee Analysis Sections

Current status: There is a basic top‑down analysis showing market fee and Louis Amy fee, but it lacks detailed scope breakdown. A bottom‑up tab exists but has scaling errors and no connection to the hours logic.

Missing:

Top‑Down fee analysis table with percent‑of‑cost, rate per ft², discipline fee, consultant fees and coordination fees for every scope.

Bottom‑Up fee analysis with team member rates, labor cost, overhead, markup, discount, and hours by role.

Hours distribution by phases (Discovery, Creative, Technical, etc.) with leverage percentages per employee type.

4. Advanced Calculation Features

Missing:

Scan to BIM cost calculations (Building and Site) using the formulas shown in the spreadsheet.

Coordination fee default of 15% for outsourced services.

Category multiplier display (Category 1–5 corresponding to 0.9–1.3) and the ability to override it.

Markup and discount controls for bottom‑up fee calculation.

5. Budget Breakdown Granularity

Current status: Budgets are split into Shell/Interior/Landscape and into engineering disciplines, but there is no new vs remodel split for each discipline and no formulas visible for how the discipline budgets are derived.

Missing:

Display of New vs Remodel budgets for each discipline.

Correct application of the remodel multiplier (50% reduction applies to structural only).

Allow overrides for discipline share percentages and reflect them in the calculations.

6. Project Hours Calculations

Current status: Hours per ft² factor slider is present but simplified (e.g., fixed at 0.5).

Missing:

Computation of hours using the non‑linear formula based on total area and category multiplier, with separate factors for new (0.9) and remodel (0.8) work.

Phase‑based hours distribution (Discovery, Creative – Conceptual, Creative – Schematic, etc.).

Employee‑specific hour allocations and leverage percentages.

7. Sanity Check and Validation

Missing:

Market comparison or “sanity check” that compares top‑down and bottom‑up results (percent differences).

Manual discount override fields and validation of user input ranges.

Visual indicators if top‑down and bottom‑up fees diverge significantly.

8. Input Parameter Organization

Missing:

Proper mapping from building tier to design level (1=Basic, 2=Standard, 3=Full).

Category selection with multiplier mapping (Category 1–5 → 0.9–1.3).

Site area input specifically for Scan to BIM calculations.

9. Visual Data Presentation

Missing:

Donut charts to display New vs Remodel ratios.

Missing:

Expandable cards or collapsible sections for detailed breakdowns (e.g., discipline budget splits and formulas).

Range bars for cost analysis (sliders) instead of static values.

10. Calculation Engine Gaps

Missing:

VLOOKUP-like logic for retrieving engineering cost percentages from the CSV or database.

Dynamic fee calculations that adjust based on project scope (e.g., turning services on/off).

Hours rebalancing based on contract price, as shown in the Excel sheet.

Overall Coverage

As you noted, the app currently implements only about 40 % of the spreadsheet’s functionality. The most critical missing elements are the fee analysis sections (top‑down and bottom‑up) and interactive controls that let users override default values.
