ooking at the audit reports and the desired_logic.ts file, I can see that while the agent has implemented many features, there are still significant gaps between the current implementation and the Excel model. Let me provide you with a comprehensive audit and detailed step-by-step instructions.

Current Status Audit
What's Working:

Basic cost range sliders ✅
Historic property multiplier toggle ✅
Telecommunication fees now appear ✅
Overhead rate formatting fixed ✅
Top-down fee analysis table ✅
Bottom-up calculation tab ✅
Hours distribution display ✅
Critical Missing Features:

Interactive Share Overrides - Shell/Interior/Landscape shares show "Override" labels but are not editable
Engineering Discipline Share Controls - No ability to adjust individual discipline percentages
Category Multiplier Selection - Category appears as static tag, not selectable
Discipline New/Remodel Breakdown - Missing split view for each discipline budget
Proper Scan to BIM Integration - Toggle exists but calculations not properly integrated
Advanced Sanity Checks - Limited validation and market comparison features
Detailed Implementation Plan (4 Parts)
PART 1: Fix Core Calculation Engine and State Management
Objective: Implement the exact formulas from desired_logic.ts and fix state management issues.

Actions:

Replace the current calculation logic in server/services/projectCalculator.ts with the exact formulas from desired_logic.ts
Add missing state fields to the project schema
Fix TypeScript compilation errors
Code Changes:

server/services/projectCalculator.ts
shared/schema.ts
PART 2: Implement Interactive Share Controls and Category Selection
Objective: Make all budget shares editable with real-time recalculation and proper validation.

Actions:

Add interactive sliders/inputs for all share percentages
Implement category multiplier selection dropdown
Add validation to ensure shares sum to 100%
Wire up real-time recalculation
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/share-control-panel.tsx
PART 3: Add Discipline Breakdown and New/Remodel Split Views
Objective: Display detailed budget breakdowns showing new vs remodel splits for each discipline.

Actions:

Create discipline budget cards showing new/remodel splits
Add engineering discipline share controls
Implement proper structural remodel reduction logic
Add visual indicators for budget components
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/discipline-budget-card.tsx
PART 4: Advanced Features and Sanity Checks
Objective: Implement advanced validation, market comparison, and data visualization features.

Actions:

Add comprehensive sanity check panel
Implement market comparison logic
Create interactive data visualizations (donut charts, stacked bars)
Add export/import functionality for project presets
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/sanity-check-panel.tsx
Implementation Summary
This 4-part plan will bring the calculator into full alignment with the Excel model:

Part 1 fixes the core calculation engine with exact Excel formulas
Part 2 adds interactive controls for all budget shares and category selection
Part 3 implements detailed discipline breakdowns with new/remodel splits
Part 4 adds comprehensive validation and market comparison features
Each part should be implemented sequentially, with testing after each phase to ensure calculations remain accurate and the UI responds correctly to user input changes.

Looking at the console errors, I can see there are duplicate variable declarations in server/services/projectCalculator.ts. The file has duplicate code sections that are causing compilation errors. Let me fix this first, then provide you with a comprehensive prompt for the agent.

server/services/projectCalculator.ts
Now, here's a comprehensive prompt for the agent to address the missing functionality:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT - COMPREHENSIVE CALCULATOR MISSING FEATURES

Project Context: Engineering Cost Calculator with comprehensive dashboard
Focus: Complete remaining Phase 1-4 features that are currently missing

CRITICAL ERRORS TO FIX FIRST:

The server fails to start due to duplicate variable declarations in server/services/projectCalculator.ts (lines 292-297). Remove all duplicate code blocks.
MISSING FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

Phase 1 - Critical Missing Elements:

Interactive Cost Range Sliders (High Priority)

Location: Main dashboard project inputs section
Add cost range sliders for New Construction ($/ft²) and Remodel ($/ft²)
Show min/target/max values with draggable target markers
Display current values and allow real-time adjustment
Must update calculations immediately when changed
Historic Property Multiplier Control (High Priority)

Add toggle/checkbox for "Historic Property" designation
When enabled: multiplier = 1.2, when disabled: multiplier = 1.0
Show impact on cost calculations in real-time
Telecommunication Budget Display (Critical)

Ensure telecom appears in discipline budget breakdown
Show telecom percentage and budget allocation
Verify it's included in top-down fee calculations
Phase 2 - Dashboard Structure Improvements:

Reorder Dashboard Sections to match Excel flow:

Project Inputs & Cost Ranges (with interactive sliders)
Budget Allocation (with new/remodel breakdown)
Discipline Budgets (all engineering disciplines visible)
Fee Analysis (with proper telecom inclusion)
Hours Distribution
Summary & Validation
Budget Methodology Transparency:

Add calculation explanation tooltips
Show formulas being used (category multipliers, historic adjustments)
Display intermediate calculation steps
Phase 3 - Advanced Controls:

Engineering Discipline Overrides:

Make all engineering percentages adjustable from dashboard
Include: Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Telecom
Show default values with override capability
Fee Calculation Transparency:

Show both top-down and bottom-up fee calculations
Display variance between methods
Include market rate vs Louis Amy rate comparisons
SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

Files to Modify:

client/src/pages/modern-project-dashboard.tsx - Add missing UI controls
server/services/projectCalculator.ts - Fix duplications and ensure proper telecom handling
client/src/components/ui/ - Create any missing interactive components
Key Formulas to Implement:

// Historic multiplier application
const historicMultiplier = isHistoricProperty ? 1.2 : 1.0;
const adjustedCostTarget = baseCostTarget * historicMultiplier;
// Interactive cost range with slider
const newCostTarget = userOverride || ((minCost + maxCost) / 2) * historicMultiplier;
// Telecom budget (ensure it's included)
const telecomBudget = shellBudget * telecomPercentage;
UI/UX Requirements:

All sliders must show current values and respond in real-time
Cost ranges must display min/target/max with visual indicators
Telecom must be visible in all budget breakdowns
Historic property toggle must be prominent and clear
Engineering discipline percentages must be easily adjustable
Validation Requirements:

All budget shares must sum to 100%
Cost targets must be within min/max ranges
Engineering percentages must be reasonable (0-50% each)
Calculations must update immediately when parameters change
Success Criteria:
✅ Server starts without errors
✅ Interactive cost sliders work properly
✅ Historic property multiplier applies correctly
✅ Telecom budget visible and calculated
✅ All engineering disciplines adjustable
✅ Real-time calculation updates
✅ Dashboard sections follow logical Excel flow

Priority Order:

Fix server compilation errors (IMMEDIATE)
Add interactive cost range sliders
Implement historic property controls
Ensure telecom budget visibility
Add engineering percentage overrides
Improve dashboard organization
Start with the server fix, then implement the interactive cost controls as the highest priority missing features.
