Looking at the audit reports and the desired_logic.ts file, I can see that while the agent has implemented many features, there are still significant gaps between the current implementation and the Excel model. Let me provide you with a comprehensive audit and detailed step-by-step instructions.

Current Status Audit
What's Working:

Basic cost range sliders ✅
Historic property multiplier toggle ✅
Telecommunication fees now appear ✅
Overhead rate formatting fixed ✅
Top-down fee analysis table ✅
Bottom-up calculation tab ✅
Hours distribution display ✅
Critical Missing Features:

Interactive Share Overrides - Shell/Interior/Landscape shares show "Override" labels but are not editable
Engineering Discipline Share Controls - No ability to adjust individual discipline percentages
Category Multiplier Selection - Category appears as static tag, not selectable
Discipline New/Remodel Breakdown - Missing split view for each discipline budget
Proper Scan to BIM Integration - Toggle exists but calculations not properly integrated
Advanced Sanity Checks - Limited validation and market comparison features
Detailed Implementation Plan (4 Parts)
PART 1: Fix Core Calculation Engine and State Management
Objective: Implement the exact formulas from desired_logic.ts and fix state management issues.

Actions:

Replace the current calculation logic in server/services/projectCalculator.ts with the exact formulas from desired_logic.ts
Add missing state fields to the project schema
Fix TypeScript compilation errors
Code Changes:

server/services/projectCalculator.ts
shared/schema.ts
PART 2: Implement Interactive Share Controls and Category Selection
Objective: Make all budget shares editable with real-time recalculation and proper validation.

Actions:

Add interactive sliders/inputs for all share percentages
Implement category multiplier selection dropdown
Add validation to ensure shares sum to 100%
Wire up real-time recalculation
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/share-control-panel.tsx
PART 3: Add Discipline Breakdown and New/Remodel Split Views
Objective: Display detailed budget breakdowns showing new vs remodel splits for each discipline.

Actions:

Create discipline budget cards showing new/remodel splits
Add engineering discipline share controls
Implement proper structural remodel reduction logic
Add visual indicators for budget components
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/discipline-budget-card.tsx
PART 4: Advanced Features and Sanity Checks
Objective: Implement advanced validation, market comparison, and data visualization features.

Actions:

Add comprehensive sanity check panel
Implement market comparison logic
Create interactive data visualizations (donut charts, stacked bars)
Add export/import functionality for project presets
Code Changes:

client/src/components/ui/sanity-check-panel.tsx
Implementation Summary
This 4-part plan will bring the calculator into full alignment with the Excel model:

Part 1 fixes the core calculation engine with exact Excel formulas
Part 2 adds interactive controls for all budget shares and category selection
Part 3 implements detailed discipline breakdowns with new/remodel splits
Part 4 adds comprehensive validation and market comparison features
Each part should be implemented sequentially, with testing after each phase to ensure calculations remain accurate and the UI responds correctly to user input changes.
